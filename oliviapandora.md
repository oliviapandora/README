💻Marketing Specialist who decided to start coding. I'm exploring the intersection between modern marketing + tech.

About
Curiosity led me to programming. While working on my first portfolio I realized my lack of technical skills was restricting my creativity. Website templates are improving as time goes by, but I craved more flexibility. Starting with HTML and CSS, I used freeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design Certification to learn. During this time, I discovered my passion for cybersecurity.  Now, I’m learning Python, I started with Python Principles and am currently working through freeCodeCamp’s course (in beta) and some additional small projects!
Honestly, what I enjoy the most about coding is the ability to solve complex problems. It keeps me creative and encourages me to work outside of my comfort zone.
I’m inviting you to stay curious and keep asking good questions.
