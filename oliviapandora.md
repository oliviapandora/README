<h3>‚ú®Curiosity led me to programming</h3>
<p>While working on my first portfolio I realized my lack of technical skills was restricting my creativity. Website templates are improving as time goes by, but I craved more flexibility. Then I began to wonder: How would my website look if I could to code? Starting with HTML and CSS, I used freeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design Certification to learn. During this time, I discovered my passion for cybersecurity and data security. After finishing my freeCodeCamp certification, I decided to learn Python because of it versatility.
I started with Python Principles and am currently working through freeCodeCamp‚Äôs new Scientific Computing with Python course and some additional small projects (both Python + frond-end)

What I enjoy the most about coding is the ability to solve complex problems.  It keeps me on my toes and encourages me to work outside of my comfort zone! <i>I'm inviting you to stay curious and keep asking good questions.</i></p>
