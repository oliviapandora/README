Marketing Strategist who decided to start coding. I'm exploring the intersection between modern marketing + tech.

While working on my first portfolio I realized my lack of technical skills was restricting my creativity. Website templates are improving as time goes by, but I craved more flexibility. Then I began to wonder: How would my websitelook if I could to code? Starting with HTML and CSS, I used freeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design Certification to learn. During this time, I discovered my passion for cybersecurity.  Now, I’m learning Python, I started with Python Principles and am currently working through freeCodeCamp’s course and some additional small projects!

Honestly, what I enjoy the most about coding is the ability to solve complex problems. It keeps me on my toes and encourages me to work outside of my comfort zone.
